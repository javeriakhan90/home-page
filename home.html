    A facial is a spa therapy and massage that leaves your skin cleaner, softer, younger,
     and truly transformed. Facials can help clear clogged pores, quench parched skin and 
     remove dead cells. Facials involve some massage which aids in blood circulation and
      lymphatic drainage. The facial massage also helps to relax facial muscles which 
      can slow the onset of wrinkles on the face. Puffiness reduction, sagging in the face
       and skin cell renewal are additional benefits from these massage techniques

        Obviously eyebrows can make your face more attractive. The brow shape is based on 
        a few key factors: arch, length, and thickness. Whichever shape you decide should
         act as a redundant aspect by detracting from your least favorite features and
          drawing attention to aspects of your face that you like the most.

        Hair has always been a subject of envy and admiration throughout the world. Having 
        beautiful hair is a boon bestowed upon a lucky few. While the rest of us struggle 
        with our hair every single day, the chosen few walk the earth, unaffected, swishing
         their perfect hair and making us green with jealously.

        A woman's wedding day is something most dream of, and even plan, from the time they
         were little girls swinging on the playground. When the time actually arrives, 
         a vast number of things have to be prepared and executed. One of these is choosing
          the perfect wedding makeup look. Doing this requires several steps, such as
           prepping your skin so it will look radiant, deciding who will do your makeup, 
           and allotting time for a trial-run application (or two). It also involves
            learning how to properly apply makeup that's best suited to your complexion.
             Start now by learning the ins and outs of achieving your end goal – a glowing
              face to match you, the blushing bride.
